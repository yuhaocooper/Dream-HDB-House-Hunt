# Claude Project Context

## Project Purpose

This folder/project is dedicated to tracking our HDB house hunting journey, including:
- Property viewing notes and comments
- Key learnings and insights from each viewing
- Decision criteria and requirements
- Any other information related to house hunting

## Workflow & Information Sources

### Primary Source: ClickUp Tasks
- ClickUp is the primary source where viewing notes and comments are added
- Each property viewing or house hunting activity should have a corresponding task in ClickUp
- Tasks contain detailed notes, observations, and decisions made during viewings

### Update Process
1. **Review**: Periodically review notes and comments within ClickUp tasks
2. **Summarize**: Extract key insights, learnings, and decisions from tasks
3. **Update**: Update the `house-hunting-notes.md` file with consolidated information
4. **Track**: Maintain a clear record of viewings, eliminations, and preferences

## File Structure

### house-hunting-notes.md
Main documentation file containing:
- Detailed notes from property viewings
- Key learnings and priorities
- Requirements (negotiable and non-negotiable)

## Usage

This project serves as:
- A centralized knowledge base for all house hunting activities
- A decision-making reference for property criteria
