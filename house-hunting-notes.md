# HDB House Hunting Notes - Tiong Bahru Area

## Viewing Dates: January 31 & February 1, 2026

---

## Properties Viewed

### 1. Henderson Road - 95c (Super High Level)
**Status:** Ethnic quota issue

**Area Notes:**
- Low density area, no feeling of crowd

---

### 2. Henderson Road - Second 95 Unit (Level 10)
**Status:** NO-GO
**Viewed:** February 1, 2026

**Issues:**
- Level 10 is noisy - can hear road sounds
- Window width is a problem - makes place feel cramped
- Not open enough. Want light and windows like modern condos with wide full-length glass windows.

**Positives:**
- Living room feels wide enough
- Low density area, no feeling of crowd

**Key Insight:** This viewing confirmed the new standard 4A layout is not acceptable.

---

### 3. Kim Tian Road - 127A
**Status:** Already has a buyer at OTP phase

---

### 4. Kim Tian Road - 126A
**Status:** NO-GO
**Viewed:** February 1, 2026

**Issues:**
- West-facing living room and bedrooms - **killer for this unit**
- Views towards other blocks - disappointing
- Master bedroom small (previous owners knocked down wall to enlarge)
- Service yard has the view, but pointless since you don't spend time there

**Positives:**
- Square layout of living room makes it feel bigger
- Area is still good

**Conclusion:** Kim Tian area is acceptable, but need units facing **east side**.

**Status:** Agent did not reply

---

### 6. Redhill - 75c
**Status:** NO-GO - Entire block removed from consideration
**Viewed:** January 31, 2026

**Issues:**
- **Noise:** MRT sound is constant drone - unacceptable
- **Lighting:** Way too dark. Windows aren't great. Dark corners in entryway and dining area.
- **Tiles:** Ugly (applies to all Jan 31 viewings)
- **Layout:** Feels cramped
- **Sun:** West-facing in some rooms
- **Level:** Too low for breeze

**Positives:**

## Key Learnings & Priorities

### Yuhao's Priorities

| Priority | Requirement | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Wide windows throughout | **NON-NEGOTIABLE** |
| Level 15+ | **NON-NEGOTIABLE** |
| Openness & windiness | Required |
| Unobstructed views | Required |
| No west-sun | Required |
| Quiet (no constant drone) | Required |

**Noise Benchmark:** Current room has some vehicle sounds that go unnoticed most of the time. This level of background noise is acceptable.

### Babe's Priorities
1. **Convenience** of the area
2. **Brightness** of the space
3. **Openness** - Must not feel cramped

**Decision Rule:** If a place excels in these core areas, it outweighs other factors as long as they remain acceptable.

---

## Major Decision: New 4A Layout

### Question (from Jan 31)
> Do newer 4A models have adequate living room width, or need to knock out a room?

### Answer (Feb 1 - After Henderson 95 viewing)

**The new standard 4A layout is NOT acceptable.**

- Feels dead and uninspiring
- Not open - feels cramped and trapped
- Lack of light and windows is a killer
- 5-room layouts feel better

**Preference Order:**
1. Older 4-room designs (larger windows)
2. 5-room in less accessible area
3. ~~New standard 4A~~ - REJECTED

**Status:** Leaning strongly towards rejecting all new standard 4A layout units. Will confirm with next week's viewings at:
- Boon Keng
- Telok Blangah
- Strathmore

## General Requirements

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Wide windows throughout | **NON-NEGOTIABLE** | Want slider/foldable windows, no grills. Full-length glass like modern condos. |
| Above level 15 | **NON-NEGOTIABLE** | For windiness |
| Bright interior | Required | Can't feel dark like Redhill |
| Quiet location | Required | Current room noise level is the benchmark |
| Remaining lease 70-75 years | Required | Comparable lease decay to newer flats |
| Decent primary school nearby | Required | For long-term planning |
| East-facing preferred | Required | West-facing is a killer |

---

## Long-Term Plans

### Option A: Default Plan
- **Stay minimum 8+ years** at this place
- Then potentially upgrade
- Allows committing **$100k to renovations**
- Requirements:
  - Decent primary school in area
  - Remaining lease 70-75 years

### Option B: Investment/Rental Plan
- Buy with intention of **renting out when upgrading**
- Buy older flat at cheaper price now
- Can buy condo later **without ABSD**
- Requirements:
  - Change HFE to **owner-occupier**
  - Accept reduced grant amount

---

## Blocks/Areas Eliminated

| Block/Area | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| Redhill 75c (entire block) | MRT noise, darkness, cramped layout, west sun |

---

## Areas Still Under Consideration

| Area | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Kim Tian Road | Good area, but need **east-facing** units |
| Cantonement Close | Has potential if right unit found |
| Henderson Road | Low density, but need level 15+ with wide windows |

---

## Next Steps

1. Confirm 4A rejection with viewings at Boon Keng, Telok Blangah, Strathmore
2. Focus on older 4-room designs or 5-room units
3. Only view units level 15+
4. Only view units with wide windows
5. Prioritize east-facing units
6. Kim Tian area still viable - need east-facing units

---

## Open Questions

1. Are older larger flats worth it over newer 4A models given the space difference?
2. Should we prioritize location (Tiong Bahru area) or layout (5-room in less central area)?
