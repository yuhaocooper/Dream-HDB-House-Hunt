## Key Learnings & Priorities

### Yuhao's Priorities

| Priority | Requirement | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Wide windows throughout | **NON-NEGOTIABLE** |
| Level 15+ | **NON-NEGOTIABLE** |
| Openness & windiness | Required |
| Unobstructed views | Required |
| No west-sun | Required |
| Quiet (no constant drone) | Required |

**Noise Benchmark:** Current room has some vehicle sounds that go unnoticed most of the time. This level of background noise is acceptable.

### Babe's Priorities
1. **Convenience** of the area
2. **Brightness** of the space
3. **Openness** - Must not feel cramped

**Decision Rule:** If a place excels in these core areas, it outweighs other factors as long as they remain acceptable.

### New Learnings from 2nd Weekend

1. **Bay window ledges are a deal-breaker** - Takes up space with no value
2. **5-room size (1200sqft) is the perfect size** - Confirmed with 108C McNair viewing
3. **Kitchen door relocation** - Can help open up living room space
4. **Area/location can outweigh layout** - As long as size/layout remain acceptable (not dealbreakers)
5. **Full-length windows make a huge difference** - 80A Telok Blangah level 28/29+ example
6. **Sea views are a game-changer** - Worth prioritizing when available

---

## Major Decision: New 4A Layout

### Question (from Jan 31)
> Do newer 4A models have adequate living room width, or need to knock out a room?

### Initial Answer (Feb 1 - After Henderson 95 viewing)

**The new standard 4A layout is NOT acceptable.**

- Feels dead and uninspiring
- Not open - feels cramped and trapped
- Lack of light and windows is a killer
- 5-room layouts feel better

### Updated Answer (After 2nd Weekend - Telok Blangah viewings)

**The new standard 4A layout is ACCEPTABLE - not ideal, but not a dealbreaker.**

**Key Realizations:**
- External factors (location, area, views) and design examples showed the 4A layout can work well
- With proper design/renovation (knocking down kitchen walls, strategic furniture placement), the space opens up significantly
- **Telok Blangah 93B** (4A layout) is the clear favorite for BOTH of us despite the layout
- The superior location, sea views, and area quality outweigh the layout limitations

**Revised Preference Order:**
1. **Great location with 4A layout** (e.g., Telok Blangah 93B) - NOW ACCEPTABLE
2. Older 4-room designs (larger windows)
3. 5-room in less accessible area

**Conclusion:** Layout is important but can be overcome with the right location and external factors. Not a dealbreaker anymore.

## General Requirements

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Wide windows throughout | **NON-NEGOTIABLE** | Want slider/foldable windows, no grills. Full-length glass like modern condos. |
| Above level 15 | **NON-NEGOTIABLE** | For windiness |
| Bright interior | Required | Can't feel dark like Redhill |
| Quiet location | Required | Current room noise level is the benchmark |
| Remaining lease 70-75 years | Required | Comparable lease decay to newer flats |
| Decent primary school nearby | Required | For long-term planning |
| East-facing preferred | Required | West-facing is a killer |

---

## Long-Term Plans

### Option A: Default Plan
- **Stay minimum 8+ years** at this place
- Then potentially upgrade
- Allows committing **$100k to renovations**
- Requirements:
  - Decent primary school in area
  - Remaining lease 70-75 years

### Option B: Investment/Rental Plan
- Buy with intention of **renting out when upgrading**
- Buy older flat at cheaper price now
- Can buy condo later **without ABSD**
- Requirements:
  - Change HFE to **owner-occupier**
  - Accept reduced grant amount

---

## Blocks/Areas Eliminated

| Block/Area | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| Redhill 75c (entire block) | MRT noise, darkness, cramped layout, west sun |
| 38C Bendemeer Road (entire block) | Poor Boon Keng area, bay window ledge, distance to MRT, small master room |
| 83 Strathmore Avenue | Penrith condo construction for 4 years, above budget (1.2 Mil) |
| Strathmore 61B/61C | Bay window ledges (deal-breaker), views face opposite blocks |

---

## Areas Still Under Consideration

| Area | Tier | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **Telok Blangah** | 1 | **TOP PRIORITY** - 93B sea-facing, level 20+. 80A also good alternative |
| Kallang | 2 | 2D Upper Boon Keng - decent option, excellent convenience |
| Strathmore | 2 | 61A acceptable if level 20+, but bay window ledges are problematic |
| Cantonement | 3 | Has potential if right unit found |
| Henderson | 4 | Low density, need level 15+ with wide windows |
| Kim Tian | 5 | Good area, need **east-facing** units |
| Boon Keng | 7 | 108C McNair acceptable if high floor, but area is bottom tier |

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Now - May 2026)
1. **Wait for SBF ballot results** (by May 2026) for Bishan Ridges
2. Confirmed good to stay at Bishan Ridges for 5+ years if get top 3-5 units
3. No need to refresh HFE - only needed at OTP time (confirm with agents)

### If SBF Unsuccessful (Post-May 2026)
1. **Target Telok Blangah 93B** sea-facing units, level 20+
2. Budget: 1-1.1 Mil
3. Look for units where kitchen walls can be knocked down for open living
4. Prioritize sea-facing orientation in this specific block

### General Search Criteria (If Continuing)
1. Continue focusing on older 4-room designs or 5-room units (1200sqft ideal)
2. Only view units level 15+ (preferably 20+)
3. Only view units with wide windows (avoid bay window ledges)
4. Avoid blocks with ongoing/planned nearby construction
5. Prioritize quiet areas with good views

---

## Open Questions

1. ~~Are older larger flats worth it over newer 4A models given the space difference?~~ **ANSWERED:** Yes, older 4-room or 5-room preferred. New 4A layout rejected.
2. ~~Should we prioritize location (Tiong Bahru area) or layout (5-room in less central area)?~~ **ANSWERED:** Location/area can outweigh layout if layout remains acceptable.
3. Will need to confirm with agents about HFE refresh timing (only needed at OTP?)
